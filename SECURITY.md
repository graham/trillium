# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until Trillium reaches 1.0, only the most recent release will be certainly be supported for security updates, but an effort will be made to backport critical patches when possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email [hi@jbr.me](mailto:hi@jbr.me) and/or contact me on [signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIAarILo8OPFVt2qMCYgtDsPwOwwf_zVkZcDi7HEnF-BUEhAOAw28LIdxCfjbSiOJ36jB). The latter is an experiment, so please follow up by email additionally for now.

Feel free to [draft a GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/trillium-rs/trillium/security/advisories/new) in addition to the above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please do not _exclusively_ file a GitHub security advisory without also reaching out on another channel. GitHub's notifications for draft security advisories are inadequate and too easily missed.
